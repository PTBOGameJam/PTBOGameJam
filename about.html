            <p>The PTBO Game Jam is a bi-annual not-for-profit event managed by industry professionals hosted in beautiful Peterborough Ontario, Canada. It is a gathering of people from all walks of life; from seasoned game developers and students just entering the industry, to hobbyists and enthusiasts all eager to engage and see what they can produce in a short timeframe.</p>
            <p>Originally created in July 2016 by <a href="http://reapazor.com">Matthew Davey</a> with the support of <a href="http://dotbunny.com/">dotBunny</a>. The intent was to foster and support the local video game development industry, as well as develop a community that would eventually be able to take over in organizing the event. It only took a matter of weeks before other awesome 'like-minded' individuals were volunteering their support for this noble cause.</p>
            <p><em>Getting Shit Done&trade;</em> is the team's ethos &#8212; demonstrating what a collection of skilled professionals can accomplish when united under a common banner.</p>
