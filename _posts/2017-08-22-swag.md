Jammers have been asking for it since [01](http://ptbogamejam.com/archive/01/), and it is about time we delivered. Like anything we do, it had to be right, and it had to be awesome! We went to all sorts of different vendors trying to find the best brands, and the best quality product for PTBO Game Jam branded products. We are proud to announce a partnership with Entripy in creating a "Swag Shop" that stands up to our highest of standards.

Now jammers can support and promote this awesome community and event with a wide variety of branded products. All products are shipped from Oakville, Ontario ... which means FAST delivery times, and no duty crossing the border. You spoke and we listened.
