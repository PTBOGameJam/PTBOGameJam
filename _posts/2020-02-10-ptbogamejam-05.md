_Peterborough, Ontario – February 10, 2020_ – From somewhere in deep uncharted territory, another installment of PTBO Game Jam has been unearthed!

**PTBO Game Jam 05** will take place **Saturday, March 14 to Sunday March 15** in a fan-favorite conference space at Fleming College’s Kawartha Trades & Technology Centre, 559 Brealey Drive in Peterborough, Ontario.

Powered by the Peterborough-based game development studio [dotBunny](http://dotbunny.com), the [Fleming Computer Club](https://www.flemingclub.ca/), the [Pinnguaq Association](https://pinnguaq.com/) and [Fleming College’s School of Trades and Technology](https://flemingcollege.ca/), **PTBO Game Jam 05** is a weekend-long hackathon-style video game development event. The jam will see video game programmers, designers, artists and more gather to plan, design and create video games in a 32-hour marathon!

Once more, PTBO Game Jam is three events in one, with opportunities for people of any age and skill level to explore the world of video game development.

This includes the [Pinnguaq Association](https://pinnguaq.com/)’s **Youth Educational Block**, which specially focuses on introducing youth under the age of 16 to making video games with free technology geared directly to them. From 6:30PM to 8:30PM on Friday March 13th we’ll be demonstrating how to use MIT’s toolset Scratch to create a simple game mechanic, and show how it can be easily changed and modified to create unique and fun gameplay. Be forewarned - no more than 45 participant spots are available!

The event also includes an **Adult Educational Block** geared at people aged 16 and over. From 6:30PM to 8:30PM on Friday March 13th we’ll take attendees from zero to hero with industry standard development toolsets to create a quick simple video game that can be expanded on at the game jam itself. 

Those blocks build up to the star of the show: the Jam itself, which starts **Saturday, March 14 at 9 a.m. and continues until 5 p.m. Sunday, March 15**.

The pressure, pizza, and awesomeness can be yours, as once again admission to **PTBO Game Jam 05** is **free**. Pre-registration is required however, and one must visit [https://ptbogamejam05.eventbrite.ca/](https://ptbogamejam05.eventbrite.ca/) and click the Register button to join. Please note that prior registration is required for each event you plan to participate in!
