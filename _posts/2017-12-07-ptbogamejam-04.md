_Peterborough, Ontario – December 7, 2017_ – The old adage "too much of a good thing" simply does not apply when it comes to the **PTBO Game Jam**. Participants simply can’t get enough of this innovative tech event!
  
**PTBO Game Jam 03** will be staged **Friday, February 23 to Sunday, February 24**, once again returning to the conference space at Fleming College’s Kawartha Trades and Technology Centre, 559 Brealey Drive in Peterborough.
  
Hosted by Peterborough-based game development studio [dotBunny](http://dotbunny.com), **PTBO Game Jam 04** will see game programmers, designers, artists and others involved in game-development disciplines gather to plan, design and create games in a 32-hour time frame.
  
**PTBO Game Jam 04** is actually three events rolled into one, with two Educational Blocks being offered in addition to the 32-hour game creation marathon. 
  
On Friday, February 23, 6 to 8 p.m., a **Youth Educational Block** will focus on introducing youths under the age of 16, accompanied by a guardian, to the world of game development via the provision of free toolsets geared to them. The block includes instruction on how to use MIT’s Scratch to create a simple game mechanic, showing how it can be easily changed and added onto to create fun and unique gameplay.
  
Also Friday, February 23, 6 to 9 p.m., an **Adult Educational Block** will provide a terrific opportunity for those 16 years old and older who have wanted to create a game but didn’t know where to start. Again, instruction on the use of game creation industry toolsets will be provided to help participants create a simple game that can be expanded upon.
  
That sets the stage for the main event which starts **Saturday, February 24 at 9 a.m. and continues until 5 p.m. Sunday, February 25**. Organizers confirm “there will be pressure, there will be pizza and there will be awesomeness” as new games are created around a forthcoming theme.
  
Admission to **PTBO Game Jam 04** is again **free** but pre-registration is required. Visit [https://ptbogamejam04.eventbrite.ca/](https://ptbogamejam03.eventbrite.ca/) and click the Register button. Please note that a ticket is required for each event you plan to participate in.
  
**PTBO Game Jam History**  
  
With the goal of fostering a local game development community to the benefit of future generations of game developers, **Matthew Davey**, the founder of Peterborough-based game development studio [dotBunny](http://dotbunny.com), organized and hosted the inaugural not-for-profit **PTBO Game Jam 01** in August 2016 at the Holiday Inn Peterborough-Waterfront. That event saw 11 games created.
  
Based on the response to, and success of, that initial foray, follow-up events continue to be held with continual growth and reach.
  
With the organization of **PTBO Game Jam 04**, a team of industry professionals continues to work together towards the continued success of the **PTBO Game Jam** to the benefit of the industry as a whole as well as participants. 
  
It’s estimated that more than 19 million Canadians identify themselves as "gamers," participating, at some level, in an industry which is expected to grow to a startling $100 billion market value come 2019.
