_Peterborough, Ontario - May 18, 2018_ -  Hi everyone! It’s announcement time here at PTBO Game Jam.

**PTBO Game Jam** is officially now an **annual** event. This means **PTBO Game Jam 05** will be taking place in **October 2018**, and that **no physical jam will be taking place this summer**.

We’ve been seeing such great growth that we’re having trouble finding a venue that can provide the services we need.

Resources like our **[website](http://ptbogamejam.com/)**, **[jam archives](http://ptbogamejam.com/archive/)**, **[community Discord server](http://discord.me/ptbogamejam)**, and **[monthly meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PTBOGameDev/)** will always be available.

**As always, we want to your your thoughts and input**. You can contact us directly through the means available on our **[contact page](http://ptbogamejam.com/contact/)** or drop directly into the **[Discord server](http://discord.me/ptbogamejam)** (it’s free, fast, and a great way to connect with your fellow jammers) and speak your mind!

   
### THANK YOU! YES, _YOU_!
**PTBO Game Jam** is a **non-profit** event run by passionate volunteers with the goal of fostering and supporting the local video game development industry while growing the tech presence in the city. We are currently one of the few organizations providing unique opportunities for children and adults to gain experience developing highly in-demand technical skills. We all do it for you **jammers** and can’t thank you all enough for participating in the jams, coming out to meetups, and just generally being **amazing**!

**PTBO Game Jam** wouldn’t be possible without the space and funding provided by **sponsors** in our community who we collaborate with! To the sponsors who have supported making **PTBO Game Jam** a reality, we thank you. **Thank you** for **everything** that you’ve done that has helped take Peterborough into the future by bringing experience, industry, and excitement to our community!

  
### WHAT'S NEXT?

**Matthew Davey**   
Founder &amp; Organizer
  
With the goal of fostering a local game development community to the benefit of future generations of game developers, **Matthew Davey**, the founder of Peterborough-based game development studio [dotBunny](http://dotbunny.com), organized and hosted the inaugural not-for-profit **PTBO Game Jam 01** in August 2016 at the Holiday Inn Peterborough-Waterfront. That event saw 11 games created.
  
Based on the response to, and success of, that initial foray, follow-up events continue to be held with continual growth and reach.
  
With the organization of **PTBO Game Jam 04**, a team of industry professionals continues to work together towards the continued success of the **PTBO Game Jam** to the benefit of the industry as a whole as well as participants. 
  
It’s estimated that more than 19 million Canadians identify themselves as "gamers," participating, at some level, in an industry which is expected to grow to a startling $100 billion market value come 2019.
