It is coming up on three months since we changed the video game development space in Peterborough, Ontario with the first ever PTBO Game Jam. Our work has never stopped since that eventful day. We have been hard at work day in and day out, trying to further our goal of bringing the game development industry to town.

Over these past months our team has [expanded](/about/) to take some of the load off Matthew, so he can do some actual paid work. Weâ€™ve been talking with much larger companies and players in the scene, educating them about our goal and our path to get there. Today we introduce our first rendition of our website, graciously hosted and powered by the wonderful sponsorship team at [GitHub](http://github.com). This new site runs on the [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) system, using a nice static site generator called [Jeykll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

The full LIVE source of the website can be found over [here](http://github.com/PTBOGameJam/PTBOGameJam).
