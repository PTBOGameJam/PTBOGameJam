_Peterborough, Ontario – August 13-14, 2016_ - The # PTBO Game Jam # is a gathering of industry professionals, students, hobbyists and those eager to learn with the common goal of creating video games in a short period of time.

Hosted by local game development studio [dotBunny](http://dotbunny.com), founder Matthew Davey explains the reasoning behind the event as a desire to foster a local game development community, benefiting future generations of game developers. The event went from concept to securing a venue and signing up sponsors in a matter of weeks, illustrating the agility, speed, and entrepreneurial action associated with successful startups and the video game industry.

The # PTBO Game Jam # seeks to engage the local community with the video game industry to form long term relationships. The impact of a Game Jam grows far beyond Peterborough’s borders. Currently sitting at $84 billion dollars, the video game market is expected to grow to $100 billion dollars by 2019. Over 19 million Canadians identified themselves as gamers in 2015 which is approximately 54% of the population of Canada.

Sponsors include [dotBunny](http://dotbunny.com), [Epic Games](http://epicgames.com), [Unity](http://unity3d.com), [Igniter Tickets](http://ignitertickets.com), [GitHub](http://github.com), [Funky Rustic](http://funkyrustic.net), and local VR startup [ardeeXYZ](http://ardee.xyz).

The inaugural # PTBO Game Jam # runs Saturday August 13th to Sunday August 14th at the Holiday Inn Peterborough-Waterfront. Kicking off Saturday morning at 9:30 AM with a 1-hour seminar about making video games, with the 30-hour Game Jam starting at 11:00AM.
