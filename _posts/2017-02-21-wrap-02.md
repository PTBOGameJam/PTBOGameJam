“Watching the organic growth of this event has been astonishing,” enthuses principal event organizer Matthew Davey of Peterborough game development studio **dotBunny**. 

“Hearing the stories of individuals and their journeys to get here made all the work organizing it well worth it. I can't wait to see what we can do for PTBO Game Jam 03 as we are now starting to catch the eye of much larger markets.”

With the theme **Alternative Facts** at its center, the semi-annual not-for-profit showcase of all things game development saw programmers, designers, artists and others involved in game-development disciplines gather to plan, design and create games in a specified time frame. 

When all was said and done, 33 games were made and judged – 28 of those developed in the Unity game engine. Cash prizes were ultimately awarded in four categories – Over 29 Team (**Brendan Quigley**, **Chris Stretten**, **Josh Reynolds** and **Rob Waite**); Over 29 Solo (**Jeffrey Moore**); Under 29 Team (**Matthew Greer** and **Natasha Monk**); and Under 29 Solo (**Matthew Kingdon**). A paid subscription to GitHub for a year was awarded to the Most Valuable Jammer (**Arin Blue**).  

**PTBO Game Jam 02** also presented an event-opening Educational Block that featured **Robert French** who led a seminar on the steps and processes involved in the creation of **PAC-MAN**.

Davey notes **PTBO Game Jam 02** saw a huge increase in sponsor support compared to that of the inaugural event held in August 2016. Davey thanks **Fleming College**, **Funky Rustic**, **GitHub**, **IBM**, **Peterborough Tech Advisory Council**, **Ricky’s All Day Grill**, **acorn30**, **Aramark**, **Audiokinetic**, **Community Futures Peterborough**, **Gotta Havva Pizza**, **inXile Entertainment**, **Kawartha Lakes Community Futures Development Corporation**, **Liftlock Studios**, **Pagefolio** and **Unity** for their invaluable support.

**PTBO Game Jam History**  
  
With the goal of fostering a local game development community to the benefit of future generations of game developers, **Matthew Davey**, the founder of Peterborough-based game development studio dotBunny, organized and hosted the inaugural not-for-profit **PTBO Game Jam 01** in August 2016 at the Holiday Inn Peterborough-Waterfront. That event saw 11 new games created and judged. 
  
Based on the overwhelming response to, and success of, that initial gathering, plans were made to host a follow-up event in early 2017, which was held February 17 to 19 and saw 33 games created. Davey continues to work with a stellar team of industry professionals to ensure the success of the **PTBO Game Jam** to the benefit of the industry as a whole as well as participants. 
  
It’s estimated that more than 19 million Canadians identify themselves as “gamers,” participating, at some level, in an industry which is expected to grow to a startling $100 billion market value come 2019.
