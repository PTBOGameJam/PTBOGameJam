_"PTBO Game Jam 04 was a great experience for everyone involved. It wouldn't have been possible without the team of amazing volunteers, and the expanding community support we receive. I'm excited to see where things go as we continue to expand our audience. Watching our youth educational block grow has been one of the most rewarding things for me. Talking with other parents and hearing their stories, it really motivates me to keep pushing forward."_
- PTBO Game Jam founder & organizer Matthew Davey.
   
### THINK OF THE CHILDREN 
Our **educational blocks**, which teach the fundamentals of game development to jammers young and old, were a resounding success! Our **youth educational block** was a particular area of growth. It saw **8 children** and their parents successfully recreating the classic arcade game Frogger using MIT's educational programming language Scratch. Special thanks to student volunteer **Ethan Brodie** who assisted greatly during the youth block!
  
### GAME JAM: LIVE
Our popular **livestream** returned for **PTBO Game Jam 04**! Drawing in **over 600 viewers** over the 32-hours of the jam, jammers were featured to showcase their game development process to a worldwide audience!
  
### FUN AND GAMES WHILE MAKING GAMES
New to PTBO Game Jam events, jammers were treated to the opportunity to de-stress in an epic **Putt-for-Swag** event and a **Mario Kart championship**! Jammers put their mini-golf skills to the test to win awesome swag provided by [Unity](http://unity3d.com), before taking the wheel in a series of races to be Mario Kart champ! **Jairo Orlandi Neto** was the winner of the Mario Kart championship and retains the highly treasured bragging rights until the next **PTBO Game Jam**! Our special thanks and seal of approval goes to **Ben Pinto** for providing live commentary casting during the races!

### A LITTLE EXTRA LOVE
Participants have until March 2, 2018 at 11:59PM to polish their games and submit them on Itch.io. The community will then review and vote on which game they determine is the best game of **PTBO Game Jam 04**.
  
### WE LOVE OUR SPONSORS
**PTBO Game Jam 04** wouldn't have had such a successful weekend without the support from our sponsors! Our love goes out to [dotBunny](http://dotbunny.com), [Fleming College](http://flemingcollege.ca), [Funky Rustic](http://funkyrustic.net), [Community Futures Peterborough](http://communityfuturespeterborough.ca), [Greater Peterborough Innovation Cluster](http://www.innovationcluster.ca/), and [Unity](http://unity3d.com).

**Matthew Davey**   
Founder &amp; Organizer
  
With the goal of fostering a local game development community to the benefit of future generations of game developers, **Matthew Davey**, the founder of Peterborough-based game development studio [dotBunny](http://dotbunny.com), organized and hosted the inaugural not-for-profit **PTBO Game Jam 01** in August 2016 at the Holiday Inn Peterborough-Waterfront. That event saw 11 games created.
  
Based on the response to, and success of, that initial foray, follow-up events continue to be held with continual growth and reach.
  
With the organization of **PTBO Game Jam 04**, a team of industry professionals continues to work together towards the continued success of the **PTBO Game Jam** to the benefit of the industry as a whole as well as participants. 
  
Itâ€™s estimated that more than 19 million Canadians identify themselves as "gamers," participating, at some level, in an industry which is expected to grow to a startling $100 billion market value come 2019.
