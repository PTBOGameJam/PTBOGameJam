Congratulations, Doctor. You have worked very hard for this paleontology degree. Now it is time to reveal our secret. For 200 years we have been planting fossils to perpetuate the myth of dinosaurs and corrupt children. You must join our cause and bury as much evidence for evolution as you can. If you want agree... well, if there are no real dinosaurs, how will you work? And who is going to believe you?
