The year is 2260 and Earth is in trouble! A single generation of uninformed rule, a bad batch of homeopathic medicine and a poorly-timed re-release for Joel Schumacher's Batman movies have annihilated the planet's fail safes. Our defences have been overrun... by Giant Enemy Crabs. It's your job to cull the threat using your laser bullets, battleready ship. Failing that, there is always an alternative... legendary Axe.
