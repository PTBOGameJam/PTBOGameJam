As the 4th assistant undersecretary to the Deputy Minister of Administrative Policy, ordinarily your life is pretty quiet. But today, there's rumours swirling around of a juicy leak coming from your department, and the place is swarming with journalists!<br /><br />Thankfully, you had the foresight to install secret escape tunnels a few months ago. Use them to escape the office, and don't let the journalists spot you - or, just a good, bean 'em with some heavily redacted documents to take them down.
