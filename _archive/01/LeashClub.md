Have you ever walked a cat on a leash and thought to yourself; "Why am I walking my cat on a leash? This is horrible, neither the cat or I enjoy this. I wish we would be attacked by zombies that we could use our leash to fight with!"

Well that is never going to happen in real life, but in this game, that is what you do! You are welcome!
