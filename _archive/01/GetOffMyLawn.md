This game depicts an alternate universe where cats are not on leashes. The ramifications are truly terrifying as you can witness by playing the game.
<br /><br />
Defend your flower gardens by operating a state-of-the-art, mechanized, cat-deterring, high-velocity sprinkler system. Spray water on the cats to score points and annoy them. Cats will leave the garden if you keep annoying them.
<br /><br />
The game ends once all your flowers are destroyed by cats. Your final score will then be displayed.
