Please understand that while we try our best to be fast in our response times, we are all volunteering our time and have other things on our plates. That doesn't mean we aren't super, over the top, amazingly stoked to hear from you; it just means it might take us a bit to get back to you.</p>
            <p>All email related to the event(s) should be directed to <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">{{site.email}}</a>. It will find its way to the appropriate team member from there.</p>
            <p>Are you a member of the <strong>press?</strong> We have a <a href="{{site.data.links-relative.media | prepend: site.baseurl }}">portal</a> just for you!</p></div>
