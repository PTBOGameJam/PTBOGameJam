            <p>We are back! Bigger and <em>more badass</em> then before. We appreciate all the amazing feedback we received and have grown our team and refactored our formula to bring the next iteration to the <a href="#">Kawartha Trades &amp; Technology Centre</a> on <strong>February 17th-19th 2017</strong>.</p>
            <p>With more than double the sponsors the first event, we continue to engage with the local community in developing lasting relationships supporting the development of a games industry in Peterborough, Ontario. With an expanded educational block and more actual development time weâ€™re all super excited to see what gets made at the event.</p>
